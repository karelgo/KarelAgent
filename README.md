# KarelAgent Data & Analytics Platform

## Overview
This project is an advanced data and analytics platform powered by LangChain agents. The architecture includes:
- **CEO Agent**: Central decision-maker, approves all critical actions.
- **Specialist Agents**: Data Ingestion, Data Cleaning, Analytics, Visualization, Reporting.
- **Agent Communication**: Agents communicate and collaborate, but require CEO approval for final decisions.
- **REST API Endpoints**: For agent communication and decision approval.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Web interface for interacting with the agents.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain
- FastAPI (Backend API)
- Streamlit (Frontend Web App)

## Getting Started

### Local Development
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd agentsetup
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the FastAPI backend:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit frontend:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

### Azure Web App Deployment

This repository includes a CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys the Streamlit app to Azure Web App Service when code is pushed to the main branch.

#### Prerequisites
1. An Azure Web App Service instance configured for Python
2. GitHub repository secrets configured (see below)

#### Required GitHub Secrets

To enable automatic deployment to Azure Web App Service, you need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. **AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME**: The name of your Azure Web App Service
   - Example: `karelAgent-webapp`

2. **AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE**: The publish profile XML content from your Azure Web App
   - How to get this:
     1. Go to your Azure Web App in the Azure Portal
     2. Click on "Get publish profile" in the top menu
     3. Copy the entire contents of the downloaded `.PublishSettings` file
     4. Paste this as the value for the secret

#### Setting Up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret" and add each secret:
   - Name: `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME`, Value: Your Azure Web App name
   - Name: `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`, Value: Your publish profile XML content

#### Azure Web App Configuration

Make sure your Azure Web App is configured with:
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11
- **Startup Command**: `python startup.py`
- **Port**: The app will automatically use the PORT environment variable provided by Azure

#### Environment Variables (Optional)

You can configure the following environment variables in your Azure Web App:
- `BACKEND_URL`: URL of the FastAPI backend (if running separately)

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml`) automatically:

1. **Triggers on**: Every push to the main branch
2. **Build and Test**: 
   - Sets up Python environment
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs import tests
   - Validates Streamlit app syntax
3. **Deploy**: 
   - Creates a deployment package
   - Deploys to Azure Web App Service using the publish profile

## Architecture Notes

The Streamlit app serves as a frontend that communicates with the FastAPI backend. In a production deployment, you may want to:
- Deploy the FastAPI backend as a separate Azure Web App or Container Instance
- Configure the `BACKEND_URL` environment variable to point to your backend service
- Set up proper authentication and security measures

## Next Steps
- Implement agent classes and orchestration logic.
- Add inter-agent communication and CEO approval flow.
- Expand platform features as needed.
- Add comprehensive testing suite.
- Implement proper logging and monitoring.
